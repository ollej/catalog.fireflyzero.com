  A multiplayer game where you race to be the first to collect fireflies for 20 points using matching colored flashlights.

  Guide the fireflies with a flashlight matching their color. Each button activates a different colored flashlight.
  - N -- Red
  - E -- agenta
  - S -- Green
  - W -- Blue

  Different colored fireflies are worth a different amount of points, and they are less common when they're worth more points.
  - Red -- 1 point
  - Magenta -- 2 points
  - Green -- 3 points
  - Blue -- 5 points
